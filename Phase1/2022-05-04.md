# To affirm your vision every day.
- vision
  - a vivid mental image
  - visualize
    - Visualize five years from now, where would you be and who would you become.

# And don't affirm it as: "I'm trying", "I wish", "I want to". I am!

# Every single day "I am" is the creative force of the universe.

# Whatever you attach "I am" to, you will become.
